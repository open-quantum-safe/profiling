<p>Measurements for <i>x86_64</i> and <i>aarch64</i> architectures have been taken on AWS instances. Algorithms labelled <tt>-ref</tt> are reference (C-code only) implementations compiled without special CPU feature support. Algorithms labelled <tt>-noport</tt> are optimized implementations, possibly containing assembly code that can run only on the specific machine and CPU feature sets requested (skylake). Algorithms without any extension label are compiled to achieve best performance figures on the widest possible set of machines: The code relies on CPU feature set detection and is therefore portable; some algorithms not supporting dynamic feature set detection may run slower though.</p>
<p>Measurements for <i>Apple M1</i> architecture have been taken on a dedicated laptop. As that architecture does not have CPU-specific features (yet) that may or may not be present in a given runtime CPU, the figures for <tt>-ref</tt> and <tt>-noport</tt> are identical to the unlabelled, distributable performance measurements as only a single performance test with all CPU features supported by M1 are taken. </p>

<p>These graphs will be extended over time to other CPU types and cloud infrastructures.</p>
